#################Coding Challenges##################

Hello Ninja, thank you for this coding challenge.

About how I felt:
I can say, it was not that easy, and took me a good time of research and learning.
I really enjoyed learning different topics and more deep C++ concepts that are actually very important
in software developement, I've spent these last days coding a lot for this challenge and I would say it's
a great way to spend carnival holidays!



About the Challenge:

Step 1:
-Inside the Step 1 folder, I created a subFolder called Answers, there is a Word document in which I detailed the 
answers for the Questions of the Step 1.

Step 2:
-Inside the Step 2 folder, I created a subFolder called src in which there are two programs, The Step2.cpp that
contains the answers for "a" to "k". There is also another file called PetAdoptionSystem.cpp, containing a code
to show my skills in C++ and answering the question "i". The reson why I splited the code in two different files 
is to make the code more understandable, both files can compile and run without problems.

Step 3:
-Inside the Step 3 folder, I created a subFolder called Code Reviewed, containing the CodeReviewed.cpp file with 
all of my comments and feedback.

Step 4:
-Inside the Step 3 folder, I created a subFolder called src, containing the Step4.cpp file, with my solution for
the fourth challenge, it compiles an runs properly.
